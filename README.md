# Project Overview

## Project Name

Experience a Memory

## Project Description

Do you ever have a memory stand out so strongly you can remember what the street looks like, whether it was an achievement, happy moment, or just beautiful view? Or maybe one you wish to log forever? Here you can do just that, by sharing with our community your fondest memories. Create a post with the location and memory details, as well as a link to the google map location in person view, so we can all experience the view!

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP. Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

#### MVP

_These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features._

- Be a working, interactive React app, built using create react app
- Utilize React Router, installed via NPM.
- Have at least 6 separate, rendered components.
- Implement an organized and understandable React file structure.
- Utilize functional and class React components appropriately.
- Use Axios to consume data from Airtable, and GET/render that data in your components.
- Use Axios to POST/create new data on Airtable.
- Use only React for DOM Manipulation.

- use useHistory
- have map from google map populate the page so we can insert ourself in the memory setting
- have a user guide component to show how to find the embedded code on google maps street view which they will copy and paste in the form

#### PostMVP

_These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features._

- delete your post
- update your post
- report a post as inappropriate
- view collection of posts you've made - possibly by a log in
- allow user to view a random memory
- allow user to search for memory by location and/or location type
